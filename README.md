# swid-tag-buddy
A tool to provide integration of common SWID-tag related tasks under one interface.

SWID tags are XML files containing software product metadat and they exist on computing "endpoints" as well as in repositories.  Scanning for tags, extracting tag information, creating new tags, applying digital signatures to tags or validating signatures of tags - all these tasks can be orchestrated from a common interface.
