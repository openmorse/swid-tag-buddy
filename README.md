# swid-tag-buddy
A tool to provide integration of common SWID-tag related tasks under one interface.

SWID tags are XML files containing software product metadata.  Tags are placed on computing "endpoints" during software install, added as supplemental data by third party tools, and collected in repositories as "gold images" for comparison.  Scanning for tags, extracting tag information, creating new tags, applying digital signatures to tags or validating signatures of tags - all these tasks can be orchestrated from a common interface.
